# The Fossil Forum Web Scraper

The purpose of this program is to web scrape images of fossils from New Jersey. These photos are currently being used
for the creation of a deep learning tool that will be used to identify fossils from the Cretaceous of New Jersey. This
tool/model will then be installed on my website (njfossils.com) to aid users in the identification of their fossil finds.

The GitHub repository contains two files. One is meant to scrape all the images off of a single webpage of thefossilforum.com website,
while the other file will scrape a list of webpages of a particular section of the website.
